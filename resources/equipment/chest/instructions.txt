A chest armor consists of three pieces; torso, shoulders and arms.
They should reside in a 96x32 transparent PNG file, with the first 32x32 square being the torso, the second square is shoulders and the third is arms.
The sprites in each square should be centered and facing downwards.
There will be an option to add left/right specific sprites for shoulders and arms, for that you add another strip of sprites beneath the first one, like this:
[T][S][A] <- S and A will be added to both arms if image dimensions are 96x32
[ ][S][A] <- If there is an additional row, S and A here will be assigned to right shoulder and arm.

So the dimensions will be:
96x32 for a mirrored (left+right) texture.
96x64 for separate sprites on left/right arms and shoulders.

The first 32x32 square in the second row will be ignored (no need for two torsos, you freak.)
